G. Wodehouse\n- Cancel culture got Wodehouse lol\n\t- iâ€™m discovering hot water here, but the \n- So, if I understood the reading correctly, Wodehouseâ€™s works are not anti-british but appear anti-british to others\n- He\n\n### A Good Word for the Vicar of Bray\n- Who is Vicar of Bray!?\n- Itâ€™s an evergreen commentary on politics\n\t- Similarly, I though that the communist manifesto felt evergreen \n- Tangential note:\n\t- Planting trees as an act seems very nice, I want to try it\n\t- It is an idea of creating a common good that everyone can benefit from, even if it stems from a simple action\n\t\t- Donating blood as a parallel? \n\u003e â€¦ a beautiful tree which has rested the eyes of generation after generation and must surely have outweighed any bad effects which he produce â€¦\n- Jenâ€™s comments\n\t- the planting is not tangential\n\t- itâ€™s about the impact of actions\n\t- shepherd swaine poem as a feminist reading\n\t- Humans as nuanced beings (there is more to us than a good/bad deed)\n\n\n### Politics vs Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's Travels\n- Orwell discussed death of the author!\n\t- Or rather, I feel he is obsessive with the *character* of Swift, not so much the message in his writing \n\t- Same tendency is show in Wodehouse essay\n\n\u003e (p61) This ignores the fact that throughout history a similar struggle between the progress and reaction has been raging, and that the best books of any one age have always been written from several different view[]() points, some of them palpably more false than others\n\n\n- Holy books as the rewriting of same morals from different perspectives\n\t- This is probably minimising\n\n### Lear, Tolstoy and the Fool\n### Shooting an Elephant\n### In Defence of English Cooking\n### Benefit of Clergy: Some Notes on Salvador Dali\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-05T18:45:51.10341689Z","tags":null}}
