## How to start!

It starts with an idea, and the need, of needing to put it out in the world. I make some notes about what this idea is and what I want to communicate, like writing this note here.

However, I think **the most important thing is that you have fun doing it**. So any, and all, advice that I give, should be discarded if it does not make the process fun for you!

## Some reflections after almost being done

While making this zine I, at one point, turned on a candle â€“ I'm pretty sure we were on a call during that time actually â€“ and it made me think that I could use wax as a part of the zine.

However, I quickly realised that putting wax is hard because wax fucking falls off :(
Anyway, there is a page now, on the back, where wax claearly USED to be! I'm choosing to interpret it as raindrops on that page now that help the sapling grow.

## The Process
Here are some pictures of the process of me making the zine and planning it out!
