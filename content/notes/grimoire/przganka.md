> Pr≈æganka, literally meaning the burnt soup, is a great lazy hungover meal that is bound to heal any problems you have with its warm delicate touch.

The process of making przganka is incredibly simple and only needs a few ingredients.

### Ingredients
- 50g of butter
- 1000 ml of water
- 2-3 eggs
- 2-3 spoons of flour
- Salt, pepper, parsley and other egg seasoning
- *Optional*: Garlic

### Process
1. Beat the desired amount of eggs together in a bowl, the more eggs the thicker the soup
2. In a soup pot on low heat, melt your butter and (if desired) throw in that garlic (choped), sauteing it a tiny bit
3. Start adding flour into the mix, **keep the heat low** unless you want your flour to actually burn (it does not taste good)
4. After the flour is brownish in colour add in the water, stirring every so often to prevent clots of flour from being formed
5. When the water is boiling start slowly pouring them into the pot, stirring the contents. You should get eggy flakes inside of the pot
6. Stir for about 2 minutes and seazon with salt, parsley or anything else. I'd recommend quite a bit of salt since salt + egg = good.

Enjoy your soup!!
