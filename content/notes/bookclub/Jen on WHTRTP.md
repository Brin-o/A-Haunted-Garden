### General Notes
- I wanted to read this book because - like Brin -  I read a few articles about how Facebook content moderators are affected by their jobs! Cool to see many of these articles cited at the back of the book
- I wasn't entirely sure what to expect going in. I think I expected that there might be even MORE graphic descriptions of Internet Badthings than there were - I was happy that the book took such a weird, psychological, semi-arcane angle rather than indulge in torture porn for no reason
- Overall, I enjoyed this book!
- I also only started highlighting passages a little way in because I was enjoying reading too much to remember! Oops!

### BIG THEMES (and notes on them)
1. Voyeurism, and viewing things at a remove:
- "But then what could we do?"
- "All I'd done was sit here and watch"
- "Two people who know somewhere deep down they're being watched" - making out with Sigrid
3. Obsession
4. Programming and counteprogramming (and routines/repetition, both helpful and unhelpful)
- The counter-joking with offensive jokes to "prove how tough we are, how resilient, to ourselves and each other"
- THE LETTER - about how her hamster died, and then mirrored at the end as a misguided way to 'fix' things with Sigrid. What is the big fear/trauma with this letter? Presumably that she is a bad, cruel person. Maybe this has subconsciously led her to doing the job she does, as penance - or even as a way to minimise her own perceived sins
5. Illusions and warped perspectives
- The misinterpreted suicide: "That whole time it was like I'd been watching a video"
- Applying the rules of the virtual space to the real space: "would definitely see blood and maybe bits of his insides, so this isn't allowed, I remember thinking"
- Sigrid describing the girl and "with every step I wondered what our guidelines said about it"
- The video of Sigrid's assault. "Imagine this is a ticket". The inevitable end point of all this. Is it helpful? Is it healthy?
- Relationship with Sigrid like pyrite "it looks like a nugget of real gold, but when you turn down the lights... you're looking at a black, seemingly charred lump of coal"
1.  Metaphorical/emotional filth, vomit and belching that comes of repressing dark shit
- Sigrid's staining the bathroom with her work trauma being vomited up + "I feel like a goose being force-fed bullshit"
3. Human solidarity in the face of the inhumane - or, probably, co-dependency
- "we pour our leftovers into each other's half-empty glasses: Whoever has the least gets the most, that happens automatically, the routine part of our rapport"
- "In the heat of battle, love had been smoked out of its hideout" - real, or trauma-bonding? This is basically the question about everyone's relationships in this book
- Sigrid and her "miracle cures" as her coping mechanism
4. NUANCE!!! There are multiple perspectives on everything - in the job, in the relationships - and the book successfully manages to hoodwink us with its unreliable narrator. Even after we learn more about her mental state/behaviour, it's hard not to feel somewhat bad for her, and also still feel resentful towards Sigrid. The creeping sense of realisation as we realise just how affected by her job the narrator is is v v nauseating and v v heartbreaking
- Interesting, though, how Sigrid's both-sides-ism in the flat earth argument is what sets narrator off. Sigrid is either trying to stir the pot or be diplomatic - hard to tell? But narrator wants - needs, maybe - black-and-white rules, yes or no answers, and is triggered when challlenged. She wants her reality to be a certainty. "I need to check if it's true, *I need to verify it*".
(Also the passage about knowing details about Sigrid is very cute)

### The Ending
- Initial reaction: I felt it was kind of an abrupt conclusion after a lot of build-up, but then quickly decided that I love it
- It definitely successfully brings home and ties up a lot of the themes running through the rest of the book: voyeurism, obsession, warped perspectives
- I love that we end up with the narrator's attempt to mirror Sigrid's act of kindness, except it's a funhouse mirror - completely warped. She is so programmed that the only thing she can think to do is replicate what was healing for here. I feel like the ultimate message here is: ONE RULE/ONE SIZE FITS ALL is absolutely not a fucking thing, and it's obviously deluded to think that way - which is why content moderation must screw up so many people. There is always real-life context to consider, and when you're interacting with humans through the internet there will always be several layers of screen, context etc through all communication. That process leaking into the real world is bound to cause harm. Our brains were not designed to be captchas!
- "I saw myself standing there, like in the grainy footage of a security camera" - the final moment of clarity from an out-of-body perspective. Is this a turning point, or another voyeuristic delusion?
