### General Notes
- I have read Orwells classics – Animal Farm & 1984
- Most of the mentioned authors and books are alien to me, my context comes from purely reading the book
- My ability to analyse literature is very amature

### The Common Toad
- His thoughts on the "need" to be in the nature remind me a lot of what I read/know so far about Walden.
- Are we common toads that need to bury themselves into the ground every so often? 
- Jen’s thoughts:
	- living in a city to appreciate the nature
	- *politically reprehensible to enjoy something that is natural*

### In Defence of P. G. Wodehouse
- Cancel culture got Wodehouse lol
	- i’m discovering hot water here, but the 
- So, if I understood the reading correctly, Wodehouse’s works are not anti-british but appear anti-british to others

### A Good Word for the Vicar of Bray
- Who is Vicar of Bray!?
- It’s an evergreen commentary on politics
	- Similarly, I though that the communist manifesto felt evergreen 
- Tangential note:

	- It is an idea of creating a common good that everyone can benefit from, even if it stems from a simple action
		- Donating blood as a parallel? 
> … a beautiful tree which has rested the eyes of generation after generation and must surely have outweighed any bad effects which he produce …
- Jen’s comments
	- the planting is not tangential
	- it’s about the impact of actions
	- shepherd swaine poem as a feminist reading
	- Humans as nuanced beings (there is more to us than a good/bad deed)


### Politics vs Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's Travels
- Orwell discussed death of the author!
	- Or rather, I feel he is obsessive with the *character* of Swift, not so much the message in his writing 
	- Same tendency is show in Wodehouse essay

> (p61) This ignores the fact that throughout history a similar struggle between the progress and reaction has been raging, and that the best books of any one age have always been written from several different view[]() points, some of them palpably more false than others


- Holy books as the rewriting of same morals from different perspectives
	- This is probably minimising
